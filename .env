# Frontend Configuration
# The frontend now connects to the backend API instead of directly to the database

# Backend API URL (automatically set for development)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# Note: Database connections are now handled by the backend server
# No database credentials needed in the frontend for security
